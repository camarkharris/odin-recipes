    <h1>Gourmet Mushroom Risotto</h1>
    <img src="risotto.jpg" alt="a delicious plate of mushroom risotto">
    <p>This rich and creamy mushroom risotto recipe is made with risotto rice, Parmesan cheese, brandy, and mushrooms.</p>
    <p>Itâ€™s the ultimate comfort food meal, and our easy risotto recipe makes it simple to prepare!</p>
    <p>Authentic Italian-style risotto cooked the slow and painful way, but-oh so worth it. Complements grilled meats and chicken dishes very well.</p>
    <p>Check the rice by biting into it. It should be slightly al dente (or resist slightly to the tooth but not be hard in the center).</p>
