    <h2>Description</h2>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>5 to 6 cups chicken (or vegetable) stock</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>2 cups flavorful mushrooms (such as shiitake,chantrelle, or oyster) cleaned, trimmed, and cut into 1/2 to 1-inch pieces</li>
        <li>1/3 cup minced shallot or yellow onion</li>
        <li>1 3/4 cups risotto (aborio) rice</li>
        <li>2/3 cup brandy, vermouth, or dry white wine</li>
        <li>1/3 cup freshly grate parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme leaves</li>
        <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons fresh parsley or chives</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Preperation Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring the stock to a simmer in a saucepan.</li>
        <li>Melt the butter in a wide saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the mushrooms and shallots and sauté about 5 minutes (if using chanterelles, dry sauté first for a minute or two, and let the mushrooms cook in their own juices before adding the butter).</li>
        <li>Add the rice and stir to combine. Add brandy, bring to a boil, and reduce the liquid by half, about 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add 1/2 cup of stock at a time, stirring enough to keep the rice from sticking to the edges of the pan. Stir the rice almost constantly—stirring sloughs off the starch from the rice, making the creamy sauce you're looking for in a risotto.</li>
        <li>Wait until the first 1/2 cup of stock is almost completely absorbed before adding the next 1/2 cup. Repeat until all the stock has been added and absorbed.This process will take about 25 minutes. The rice should be just cooked and slightly chewy.</li>
        <li>Stir in the Parmesan cheese and thyme. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve and garnish with chopped fresh parsley or chives.</li>
    </ol>
